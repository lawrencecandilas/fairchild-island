 Fairchild Island DooM WAD
 
Fairchild Island.wad - GZDoom required; Brutal DOOM mod recommended but not needed.  This has a MAPINFO with a 1-level episode and ending like my earlier WADs, just start the game, or enter "MAP START" to restart.  Because of the high-quality MP3 music file, and the fact that this WAD has a very large number of sectors and linedefs, this WAD is big.

There is NO WAY this will work in the original DOOM2.EXE.  BOOM segfaults when trying to load this WAD.  Sorry.

Thanks for checking out this WAD.

## Story

Coming Soon!

## About this WAD

This is my third DOOM WAD project.  In this WAD I got fascinated with trying to make an ugly, decaying place.  I have decided to be somewhat unfriendly to the player; there's a couple of things that will trick you and the way through is not super straightforward.  The WAD is also somewhat long, maybe a bit too long.

I am hoping you find the combat intense but not impossible.  Good luck, and I do hope you make it out of the ancient demon-infested water shrine.

## Requirements

This WAD was developed mostly on an old 2010 Dell Precision laptop (quad-core Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM) with some development and testing happening on a garbage 2017 HP laptop (quad-core Pentium with 4GB of RAM) from Walmart.  Your system probably will run this fine.

Again: There is NO WAY this will work in the original DOOM2.EXE.  BOOM segfaults when trying to load this WAD.  Use GZDoom or equivalent.

## Hints

Coming Soon!
