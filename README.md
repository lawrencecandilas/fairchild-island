Fairchild Island.wad - GZDoom required; Brutal DOOM mod recommended but not needed.  This has a MAPINFO with a 1-level episode and ending like my earlier WADs, just start the game, or enter "MAP START" to restart.  Because of the high-quality MP3 music file, and the fact that this WAD has a very large number of sectors and linedefs, this WAD is big.

There is NO WAY this will work in the original DOOM2.EXE.  BOOM segfaults when trying to load this WAD.  Sorry.

Thanks for checking out this WAD.

## Story

You like to go fishing from time to time near a large lake.  Well, you were out on your boat, hit some unexpected craggy rocks, and crashed ashore on Fairchild Island.  Your boat is split in half and it's too far to swim back.  The island is rumored to have a hidden gateway to an ancient water shrine that's infested from demons of Hell.  Luckily you have your trusty shotgun ... and hopefully there's another boat somewhere.

## About this WAD

This is my third DOOM WAD project.  In this WAD I got fascinated with trying to make an ugly, decaying place.  I have decided to be somewhat unfriendly to the player; there's a couple of things that could trick you and the way through is not super straightforward.

The WAD is also long (maybe a bit too long), but linear after you get out of the first green-walled part.  The par time is set to 30 minutes.

I am hoping you find the combat intense but not impossible.  Good luck, and I do hope you make it out of the ancient demon-infested water shrine.

## Requirements

This WAD was developed mostly on an old 2010 Dell Precision laptop (quad-core Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM) with some development and testing happening on a garbage 2017 HP laptop (quad-core Pentium with 4GB of RAM) from Walmart.  Your system probably will run this fine.

Again: There is NO WAY this will work in the original DOOM2.EXE.  BOOM segfaults when trying to load this WAD.  Use GZDoom or equivalent.

## Hints (spoiler alert)

- In the first part where you are washed up on shore - you will need to shoot a gargoyle face to open a passageway.  You will have to do this a later time as well.

- Walk into the corner to make a hidden platform lift.  Then open the hidden wall.

- When you get to the section where there are many tall columns with enemies on them, the best thing to do will be to run to the other side where you can be somewhat safe.

- Save your BFG for use after the yellow key door.
